# Battleship

Battleship, a turn-based strategy game, represents a significant milestone in my development
journey, undertaken as part of my engagement with The Odin Project. This project provided me with
the opportunity to familiarize myself with advanced software design patterns, including the Model
View Controller (MVC) and the Publisher Subscriber system. These methodologies have significantly
enhanced the project's architecture, facilitating better organization, modularity, and
maintainability of code. As a result, the development process not only challenged my technical
abilities but also expanded my understanding of effective software design principles. Integrating
strategic artificial intelligence and an event-driven communication framework emphasized the
project's complexity and underscored its significance as a learning experience.
